        <p>Hello and welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm Muhammad Isah, a passionate computer science student with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and software development. Feel free to explore my projects, skills, and academic background.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Muhammad Isah, and I’m a passionate Computer Science student with a deep interest in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and software development. From the early days of my academic journey, I found myself drawn to the thrill of problem-solving. This naturally led me into the world of competitive programming, where I enjoy the challenge of dissecting algorithmic problems and finding efficient solutions through code. These experiences have not only sharpened my logical thinking but also helped me cultivate patience and persistence—two skills that are vital for any aspiring technologist.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Beyond competitions, my ultimate ambition is to become a researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I'm fascinated by how machines can learn, reason, and make decisions, and I am committed to contributing to the future of intelligent systems that can benefit society. As part of this journey, I continuously explore the theoretical and practical foundations of AI while building real-world skills through software projects and continuous learning.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        One thing I deeply enjoy is simplifying complexity. I believe that even the most intricate concepts can be broken down into digestible pieces, and I strive to explain things in a way that’s both intuitive and accessible—whether it’s for myself, my peers, or future learners. This mindset shapes how I approach learning, teaching, and building technology. Through this portfolio, I hope to showcase not only my work but also my growth, mindset, and dedication to becoming the best version of myself in the world of computer science and AI.

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve built a solid foundation in web development using technologies such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. I’m capable of building full web applications with dynamic content and understand how to structure clean, maintainable code. My knowledge of PHP and SQL allows me to connect the front end with databases effectively, enabling powerful and functional websites.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Beyond web development, I am proficient in Python, which I regularly use for scripting, data manipulation, problem-solving, and algorithmic challenges. I am currently learning Java to further expand my programming language toolbox and deepen my understanding of object-oriented principles in a new environment.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        What sets me apart is not just the languages I know but how I think about coding. Thanks to my background in computer science and my interest in system-level understanding, I’m able to write clean, efficient, and optimized code. I often approach problems with an awareness of how things work “under the hood”—from memory management to how the CPU interprets instructions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In addition to programming, I also have a creative side. I was once a dedicated CorelDRAW graphics designer, creating visual content for various purposes. While I don’t design as frequently today, I still carry the design sense and visual clarity that helps me present ideas neatly and professionally.
        </p>
